# Emmanuel's tests' notes

GHA SPN (spn-446692-gh-embergershared-azsql-appservice) only Contributor on RG:

- Actions deploy with success (in terms of pipeline)

- with Basic Auth OFF, it requires:

  - uses: Azure/login@v1
  then
  - uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2

Reference for App Service authentication:
[App service authentication types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-authentication-types)

As I deploy ZIP package:

- WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE=1 is required in the Configuration / Application settings

- Testing exact permission by removing SPN roles:
  - RG:
    - Contributor
  - App Service:
    - Owner
    - Website Contributor

=> GHA should fail
