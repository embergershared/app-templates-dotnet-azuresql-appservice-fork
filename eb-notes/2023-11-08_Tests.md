# Emmanuel's tests' notes

## Required for ZIP deploy package

- `WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE=1` is required in the Configuration / Application settings

## GitHub Actions Service Principal Role(s) for App Service deployment with Basic Auth OFF

### SPN details and tests

GHA SPN (spn-446692-gh-embergershared-azsql-appservice) only Contributor on RG:

- Actions deploy with success (in terms of pipeline)

- with Basic Auth OFF, it requires:

  ```yaml
  - uses: Azure/login@v1
  ```

  then

  ```yaml
  - uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2
  ```

Reference for App Service authentication:
[App service authentication types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-authentication-types)

- Testing exact required permission by removing all SPN roles at scopes:
  - RG:
    - Contributor
  - App Service:
    - Owner
    - Website Contributor

=> GHA should fail & failed

- Added Contributor on RG only and it deploys

## Script to list Role assignments

```powershell
$spnId='1c28ed60-d07f-4676-9796-4409497539ed' # spn-446692-gh-embergershared-azsql-appservice
$tenantId='8c0e4ef1-25fa-4e52-b8da-835de296826e'

az login --tenant $tenantId

# $sub_ids=$(az account list --query "[?tenantId=='$tenantId'].{id:id, name:name}" -o tsv)
$sub_ids=$(az account list --query "[?tenantId=='$tenantId'].id" -o tsv)

foreach ($sub_id in $sub_ids) {
    az account set --subscription $sub_id
    "Roles for $(az account show --query name):"
    az role assignment list --all --assignee $spnId --include-inherited --include-groups -o table
}
```

Result:

```powershell
Roles for "ME-MngEnvMCAP446692-EmmanuelBergerat-1":
Roles for "ME-MngEnvMCAP446692-EmmanuelBergerat-2":
Roles for "ME-MngEnvMCAP446692-EmmanuelBergerat-3":
Roles for "ME-MngEnvMCAP446692-EmmanuelBergerat-4":
Principal                             Role         Scope
------------------------------------  -----------  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1c28ed60-d07f-4676-9796-4409497539ed  Contributor  /subscriptions/34144584-4817-47a0-a912-bd00bae76495/resourceGroups/rg-azsql-appservice
```

### Credentials format

SPN was created with command:

```az cli
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name spn-446692-gh-embergershared-azsql-appservice --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/34144584-4817-47a0-a912-bd00bae76495 --sdk-auth
```

Result was:

```az cli
{
  "clientId": "1c28ed60-d07f-4676-9796-4409497539ed",
  "clientSecret": "******",
  "subscriptionId": "34144584-4817-47a0-a912-bd00bae76495",
  "tenantId": "8c0e4ef1-25fa-4e52-b8da-835de296826e",
  "activeDirectoryEndpointUrl": "https://login.microsoftonline.com",
  "resourceManagerEndpointUrl": "https://management.azure.com/",
  "activeDirectoryGraphResourceId": "https://graph.windows.net/",
  "sqlManagementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net:8443/",
  "galleryEndpointUrl": "https://gallery.azure.com/",
  "managementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net/"
}
```

The block is directly used as a GHA Secret named `secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS` in this step:

```yaml
      - name: Azure Login
        uses: Azure/login@v1
        with:
          creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
```

- Let's try now with OIDC connection instead of a secret

[Azure/login@v1 repo](https://github.com/Azure/login)

OIDC use setup instructions:

- To login using **OpenID Connect (OIDC) based Federated Identity Credentials**, you need to first configure trust between GitHub workflow and an Azure Managed Identity or an Azure AD App (Service Principal)
   1. Follow [this](https://github.com/Azure/login#configure-a-federated-credential-to-use-oidc-based-authentication) guidance to create a Federated Credential associated with your Azure Managed Identity or AD App (Service Principal). This is needed to establish OIDC trust between GitHub deployment workflows and the specific Azure resources scoped by the Managed Identity/service principal. (Setup steps are [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/workload-id/workload-identity-federation-create-trust?pivots=identity-wif-apps-methods-azp#github-actions))
   2. In your GitHub workflow, Set `permissions:` with `id-token: write` at workflow level or job level based on whether the OIDC token needs to be auto-generated for all Jobs or a specific Job.
   3. Within the Job deploying to Azure, add Azure/login action and pass the `client-id` and `tenant-id` of the Azure Managed Identity/service principal associated with an OIDC Federated Identity Credential created in step (i). You also need to pass `subscription-id` or set `allow-no-subscriptions` to true.
